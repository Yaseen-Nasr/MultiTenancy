# MultiTenancy
This is a multi-tenant API project that demonstrates how to implement MultiTenancy using the Flunt API approach. 
The API allows you to handle multiple tenants by filtering and organizing data based on the tenant value provided in the request header,
to validate and configure the query filters based on the tenant.
